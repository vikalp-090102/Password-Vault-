# Password-Vault-
A password vault, password manager or password locker is a program that stores  usernames and passwords for multiple applications securely, and in an encrypted  format. This method is the art of secret writing, which is used to encrypt the  plaintext with a key into ciphertext to be transferred between parties on an  insecure channel. It can be decrypted to the original plaintext. Without the 
knowledge of the key, nobody can retrieve the plaintext. Cryptography plays an essential role in many factors required for secure communication across an insecure channel, like confidentiality, privacy, nonrepudiation, key exchange, and authentication.
The purpose of this project is to provide the correct data with security to the users.For some of the users the data might be lost during the transmission process in the network and for some, the data might be changed by the unauthorized person in the network and there are some other security problems in the network.Our application will give you more Security to the data present in the network and 
there will be able to reduce the loss of data in the network which will be transmitted from the sender to the receiver using the latest technologies. The idea is to use the idea using Cipher Techniques in a file.
